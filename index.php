    <h1>Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <h2>Hello! My name is Dominic Evander Daniel, and I am currently in the 8th grade. I enjoy spending my time swimming, as it helps me stay active and focused. I am also passionate about Formula 1, where I admire the combination of speed, strategy, and precision. These interests inspire me to stay dedicated, improve myself, and always aim for excellence both inside and outside of school.</h2>
